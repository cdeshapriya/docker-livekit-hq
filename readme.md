You need to run both the game server (Colyseus-based) and the client application (CRA-based).

To run the server:
1. `yarn; yarn start` (at the top level)

To run the client:
1. `cd client`
2. `yarn; yarn start`

You should be placed into a space automatically. Open up multiple browser windows to test pairing with other users or install ngrok and send a link to a friend.
